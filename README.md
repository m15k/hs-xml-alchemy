# XML-Alchemy #

XML-Alchemy is an application that can be used as a preprocessor for various types of XML documents, converting to Haskell source code.  Initially focus will be on document type definitions ([DTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition)) and XML Schema documents ([XSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_schema)).  

Initial support will be for well defined XML pickle type of libraries like [hexpat-pickle](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hexpat-pickle) and [xml-picklers](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xml-picklers).  

This project is in the buildout phase and is not currently usable.
